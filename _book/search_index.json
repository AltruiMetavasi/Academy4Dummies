Good paper: Download Data Science in â€¦ industry (read quora, or top articles, find white paper) Data Science in Banking Data Science in Banking and Insurance Data ScienceProcess -Machine Learning 101 Kaggle 6.6 Regression Model Insurance companies heavily rely on regression analysis to estimate the credit standing of policyholders and a possible number of claims in a given time period. In a call center, we can analyze the relationship between wait times of callers and number of complaints. Retail store manager may believe that extending shopping hours will greatly increase sales. Regression analysis, however, may indicate that the increase in revenue might not be sufficient to support the rise in operating expenses due to longer working hours (such as additional employee labor charges). Hence, regression analysis can provide quantitative support for decisions and prevent mistakes due to managerâ€™s intuitions. source Predict Profit from Sales (in course materials) 6.7 Classification in Machine Learning 1 Logistic Regression: Loan default example. A banker want to be able to identify characteristics person who are more likely to defaults on loans, also it can be identify of what kind of risk (high, medium or low risks) Human Resources: The HR manager of a company wants to predict the absenteeism pattern of his employees based on their individual characteristic. kNN: cancer detection Retail to detect patterns in credit card usage.

In this domain it is also used to detect fraud customers who want to scam the bank. In finance, it is used to determine a stockâ€™s behaviour in the future. In the healthcare domain it is used to identify the correct combination of components in medicine and to analyze a patientâ€™s medical history to identify diseases. In e-commerce random forest is used to determine whether a customer will actually like the product or not. (https://towardsdatascience.com/the-random-forest-algorithm-d457d499ffcd) 6.9 Unsupervised Learning Examples of where unsupervised learning methods might be useful: An advertising platform segments the U.S. population into smaller groups with similar demographics and purchasing habits so that advertisers can reach their target market with relevant ads. Airbnb groups its housing listings into neighborhoods so that users can navigate listings more easily. Also: clustering AirBNB reviews (using Mixture Models-&gt; another method of clustering https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.03134.pdf)) Cluster Profiles based on motivations for Choosing AirbnB A data science team reduces the number of dimensions in a large data set to simplify modeling and reduce file size PCA Scenario : generated image embeddings (2048x1 vectors) for listing cover- page photoS OR rojected these long vectors onto a 2D plane using PCA techniques then use this for Classification and Deep learning to o categorize aiRBNB listing photos into different room types. 6.10 Time Series BEST BOOK EVER: https://otexts.com/fpp2 Why need time series ? Deciding whether to build another power generation plant in the next five years requires forecasts of future demand; Scheduling staff in a call centre next week requires forecasts of call volumes; Stocking an inventory requires forecasts of stock requirements For example, forecasts of electricity demand can be highly accurate because all three conditions are usually satisfied. We have a good idea of the contributing factors: electricity demand is driven largely by temperatures, with smaller effects for calendar variation such as holidays, and economic conditions. Provided there is a sufficient history of data on electricity demand and weather conditions, and we have the skills to develop a good model linking electricity demand and the key driver variables, the forecasts can be remarkably accurate. On the other hand, when forecasting currency exchange rates, only one of the conditions is satisfied: there is plenty of available data. However, we have a limited understanding of the factors that affect exchange rates, and forecasts of the exchange rate have a direct effect on the rates themselves. 6.11 Neural Network Neural Network http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html Application: Pattern classification Prediction and financial analysis, and Control and Optimization Real life example: Credit card fraud detection reportedly being used by Eurocard Nederland, Mellon Bank, First USA Bank, etc. [Bylinsky 1993]; Optical character recognition (OCR) utilized by fax software such as Calera Recognition Systemâ€™s FaxGrabber and Caere Corporationâ€™s Anyfax OCR engine that is licensed to other products such as the popular WinFax Cursive handwriting recognition being used by Lexicus2 Corporationâ€™s Longhand program that runs on existing notepads such as NEC Versapad, Toshiba Dynapad etc. [Bylinsky 1993] "],
